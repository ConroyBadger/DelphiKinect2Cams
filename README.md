# DelphiKinect2Cams

This is a demo project that uses a QT DLL that goes between Kinect20.lib and Delphi.

The source for the DLL can be found at:

https://github.com/ConroyBadger/Kinect2MultiDLL

The DLL was compiled with the Visual Studio 2013. If you are using a different
Visual Studio runtime redistributable you may need to rebuild the QT project.

You can get QT here:

The demo is a Win32 application written in Delphi 10. Simply run Kinect2Cams.exe.

There are 3 modes:

Depth - this one will show the depth om metres at the mouse cursor.

IR - this one has a divisor control to show more or less detail

Color - this one shows the full HD color image

Special thanks to Antimodular Incorporated where I worked while writing this code. They have generously allowed it into the public domain.
